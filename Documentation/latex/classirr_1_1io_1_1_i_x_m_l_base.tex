Empty class to be used as parent class for IrrXMLReader.  


{\tt \#include $<$irrXML.h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Empty class to be used as parent class for IrrXMLReader. 

If you need another class as base class for the xml reader, you can do this by creating the reader using for example new CXMLReaderImpl$<$char, YourBaseClass$>$(yourcallback); The Irrlicht Engine for example needs IUnknown as base class for every object to let it automaticly reference countend, hence it replaces \hyperlink{classirr_1_1io_1_1_i_x_m_l_base}{IXMLBase} with IUnknown. See \hyperlink{irr_x_m_l_8cpp}{irrXML.cpp} on how this can be done in detail.
